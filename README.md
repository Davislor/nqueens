# nqueens
Solver for the n-queens problem that uses symmetry-breaking and template metaprogramming in C++ to count unique and distinct solutions.  The algorithm is original and was written on a grant from Portland State University.

Since I wrote this project before I was in the habit of using version control, each `.cpp` file is a standalone implementation of the algorithm, and can be compiled and run from the command line.  Also included is a program to test hash functions for collisions.
